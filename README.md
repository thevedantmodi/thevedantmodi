I am a chef who wants to cook the tastiest mealsâ€”but where the meal is an app and the ingredients are a user interface, a powerful algorithm, or a witty use of an existing dataset.

Just like a chef who solves customersâ€™ hunger, I like to craft solutions to problems of the consumer. Iâ€™m interested in creating applications modeling transit, specifically air travel. I like leveraging existing systems (e.g. the UTC time system, or IATA airport codes) to generate helpful data for users. Projects like these help me practice the user interface and data treatment paradigms that I treasure.

I want to know how to best create applications, so Iâ€™m studying the hardware and software limitations of the appsâ€™ underlying algorithms in my studies in computer science and applied mathematics at Tufts University enable me to create applications that demonstrate the hardware and software limitations placed on algorithms.

Outside of coding, I like to document my trips with my drone, surrounded by my friends or family. Iâ€™m always excited to embark on more trips or make more applications.
