I am Vedant Modi, an end-to-end developer, energetic team player, and passionate builder of large-scale, impactful products. As I build software, I adopt new problem-solving approaches and technologies. Right now, Iâ€™m focusing on building applications centered on distributed systems, machine learning, and low-level computing. With these skills, I build real-world, scalable solutions to complex problems.

Iâ€™m a rising senior at Tufts University, where I study computer science and mathematics. I enjoy traveling to new places and love documenting those experiences through [photos and videos](https://vedantmodi.com/places).

In Summer 2025, I am a Software Engineering Intern at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., developing market technologies that support the Commercial and Investment Banking line of business.
