I am Vedant Modi, an independent developer who loves creating large-scale, open source projects. As I develop my programs, I adopt new problem-solving approaches and new technologies. Right now, I'm focusing on work relating to low-level programming, performance tuning, and cloud computing. With these tools, I am self-developing an open-source, full-stack web app.

I'm a rising senior at Tufts University where I study computer science and mathematics. I'm also an avid explorer of the world, where I love to spending my time visiting awesome destinations. During these trips, I enjoy documenting the unique experiences through photos and videos.

In Summer 2025, I am a Software Engineering Intern at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., where I'll work in Markets Technology supporting Commercial and Investment Banking.
